## This starter kit was removed

It is now possible to create a project with the same configuration as this StarterKit had using our new project template for Visual Studio or the .NET CLI, as explained in the [Introduction](https://www.cloudscribe.com/docs/introduction)
With the new project template there are even more configurable options.

If you have questions feel free to ask in our gitter chat web page:
